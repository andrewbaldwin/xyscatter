xyscatter gem

usage

  require 'xyscatter'
  
  XYscatter::xyscatter({params})
  
  where params is a hash containing
  
  :points => 2d array of data points [ [x1,y1],[x2,y2] ..[xn,yn] ]
  :background => background colour (default black)
  :scale => integer (default 5) makes resulting image scale*100 points square
  :pointcolour => colour name or html hex code, default #fedcba
  :ticks => number of ticks on each axis - minimum 1 (default 10)
  :tickcolour => colour used for ticks (default #ffffff)
  :minx => lower bound for x for plotting (default 0)
  :maxx => upper bound for x for plotting (default 100)
  :miny => lower bound for y for plotting (default 0)
  :maxy => upper bound for y for plotting (default 100)
  :filename => output file name (default /tmp/scatter.gif)
  
  Only the :points setting is needed

Note: The package does not check for sensible values 
so if you set the pointcolour and background to the same or close values
you won't see very much 
  
Extension
   If a third parameter is added to the data point (ie the array is
   [ [x1,y1,r1],[x2,y2,r2]....] ) then a circle is drawn with its centre at
   x,y and radius r
